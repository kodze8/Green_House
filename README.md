# Green Home Carbon Footprint Calculator

A collaborative project developed by a **team of 3 students** to design a **smart system for calculating household carbon footprints**.  

The system allows users to:  
- Parse and validate appliance data from JSON  
- Configure households with appliances, time windows, and regions  
- Accurately compute total carbon footprint and identify top contributors  
- Explore “what-if” scenarios and receive actionable recommendations for reducing emissions
